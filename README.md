## `thomasduffy.io`
This repo contains _everything_ behind my personal website in code! It's a static website hosted on GCP's Cloud Storage using infrastructure provisioned on GCP by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html) and static assets generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Steps
This [guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website), serves as a decent high level walkthrough of the setup (which they do manually). Most of what is contained here follows that but doing so with code (Terraform) and programmatically generated static assets (Hugo).

### Terraform
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a super useful framework developed by HashiCorp which provides a declarative language (HCL) and accompanying cli `terraform` to manage your infrastructure like code (Infrastructure-as-Code / IaC). All you have to do is specify the infrastructure you want to provision (using the `provider` modules), and **BOOM** you've got infrastructure! And you don't have to remember all the steps to put your system in a working state. 

The module to specify the infrastructure is contained within [terraform/gcp](./terraform/gcp). It provisions a managed zone for DNS, load balancers with redirect rules for HTTP -> HTTPS, and the Storage bucket containing the static assets that are the website itself.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is essentially a CI/CD pipeline built into GitHub. The nice thing is it's free for a public repository! 

With this, it's easy once our infrastructure is setup to just keep committing to this repo and our site will be updated automatically! GCP has their own [actions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/tree/master) that we make use of here to sync our assets in this [repo](./site) with the Storage Bucket on GCP. 

Here we've made use of the following secrets that you can add to a GitHub repository:
* `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The project id where your infrastructure lives on GCP.
* `GCP_SA_KEY`: This is your `account.json` file in base64 encoding. 
* `GCS_BUCKET`: The name of the bucket you provisioned (should be equivalent to your site's URL)
